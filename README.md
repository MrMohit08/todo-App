## Next. I created a simple yet functional Todo application using React and Redux. The goal was to create a user-friendly interface that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. The application supports key operations such as creating new tasks, reading existing tasks, updating task details, and deleting tasks.
## The application's components are built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The user interface is divided into React components, including a task list component, a task item component, and forms for creating and editing tasks.
## Used Bootstrap classes to style user interface elements.
## To manage the state of the application and handle user interactions, I used Redux, a predictable state container for JavaScript applications.
## I created a Redux store that holds the application's state, including the list of tasks. The store also contains reducers that specify how the state should be updated in response to actions.
## To trigger changes in the Redux store, I defined actions for each operation, such as creating, updating, and deleting tasks.
## These actions are dispatched by the user interface components.
## Reducers are responsible for processing actions and updating the state accordingly.
## The key features of this application include the ability for users to effortlessly add new tasks to their list by entering a task description. Users also have the flexibility to update task details, and to remove a task from the list, they can simply select the task they want to delete and click a 'Delete' icon. 
## My goal was to create this project is to understand the functionality of redux,  how redux works, and how it helps manage an application's data.
